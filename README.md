## Compile
To compile the project, run make in the build folder. This creates a library that can be used by other c++ programs. 
## Run
A sample program to use NBTrees is avaiable in the test folder. Run make in the test folder. Note that LD_LIBRARAY_PATH needs to be set to the location of the compiled library.
